Controller for gfxrecon-replay's remote feature.

This script sends replay settings, then reports what replay sends back. It
supports both directions of connection setup:

  * Default (listen): this controller is the server; replay dials in with
    --remote-connect.
  * --connect HOST:PORT: this controller dials out to a replay that is listening
    with --remote-listen.

Wire format: each frame is a little-endian uint32 length prefix followed by
that many payload bytes. Structured messages are JSON. A binary file payload is
a JSON "file" frame immediately followed by a raw binary frame.

Replay settings travel as key/value pairs, not as a command line: a key is a
replay option with its leading dashes stripped and '-' replaced by '_', and
every value is a string. Write them after -- as key=value, or as a bare key for
an option that takes no value; see settings_from_args().

Desktop usage (replay connects out):
    python3 scripts/replay_controller.py --listen 127.0.0.1:9001 -- --loop-count=3 capture_file=capture.gfxr
    gfxrecon-replay --remote-connect tcp:localhost:9001

Desktop usage (replay listens):
    gfxrecon-replay --remote-listen tcp:0.0.0.0:9001 capture.gfxr
    python3 scripts/replay_controller.py --connect localhost:9001 -- --loop-count=3 capture_file=capture.gfxr

Android usage (replay connects out, abstract unix socket forwarded to the PC):
    adb reverse localabstract:gfxrecon tcp:9001
    python3 scripts/replay_controller.py --listen 127.0.0.1:9001 -- capture_file=/sdcard/capture.gfxr
    # launch the replay activity with intent args: --remote-connect unix:@gfxrecon

Android usage (replay listens, abstract unix socket forwarded to the PC):
    python3 scripts/replay_controller.py --connect localhost:9001 --launch-adb -- capture_file=/sdcard/capture.gfxr
    # sets up: adb forward tcp:9001 localabstract:gfxrecon
    # launches the replay activity with intent args: --remote-listen unix:@gfxrecon

Backpressure testing (a slow controller against replay's bounded send queue):
    python3 scripts/replay_controller.py --listen 127.0.0.1:9001 --slow-recv 8 -- \\
